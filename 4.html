        target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Hypertext Markup language(HTML)</a><br>Three-time Classic Physique <strong>Olympia champion <u>Chris Bumstead</u></strong> 
    has been able to do what no other Mr. Olympia has done since seven-time Mr. O Arnold Schwarzenegger: break into the mainstream. As far as social media reach and popularity, Bumstead— or C-bum, as he’s affectionally known throughout the bodybuilding industry—and his 10.4 million followers on Instagram alone is more popular than the last three Mr. Olympias combined.</p>

    <p>The Classic Physique division was inspired by the bodybuilders of the golden era such as the legendary bodybuilder and seven-time Mr. Olympia Arnold Schwarzenegger. Since its inception in 2016, reigning three-time champion Chris Bumstead has proved to be the most complete competitor, with the most trophies under his belt.</p>
    He went into the show looking to extend his reign but faced stiff competition from Ramon Dino, who many argued had better arms than Bumstead. ‘CBum’ was also tasked with the challenge to ward off rising prospects, such as Mike Sommerfeld and Urs Kalecinski. Former victor Breon Ansley marked his last appearance in the Classic Physique category as he will move to the 212 division.

    <br><br>Terrence Ruffin and Kalecinski looked better than ever with a remarkably enhanced package. However, Bumstead led the pack once again during the prejudging. He faced heat from Ramon Dino, who was the only man left to fight it out with ‘CBum’ in the final callout.

    <br><br>In the end, Chris Bumstead’s overall package was unbeatable as he became the winner of the Classic Physique Olympia for a historic fourth time. While there were other promising contenders like Kalecinski and Mike Sommerfeld, they fell short of the top ranks.
